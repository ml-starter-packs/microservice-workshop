# microservice-workshop

This repository hosts the computational environment required to run the repos listed in `postBuild` by leveraging [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org), a free service which provides an ephemeral cloud computing environment.

CLICK THIS:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ml-starter-packs/microservice-workshop/main?urlpath=vscode/)

`[Cmd/Ctrl] + Shift + P -> Add Folder to Workspace -> [Enter]`, and your home directory will show up on the left.

To open the Terminal, `Ctrl + ^`.

You may want to run `PS1=\$\ `, with `echo PS1=\"\$\ \" >> ~/.bashrc` for it to persist.

To visit services (html pages), change your url to end with `{unique-binder-id}/proxy/{PORT}/` (trailing slash included).

Click on the badge above and you will be launched into a jupyter session.
Your file system is visible on the left-panel, and "apps" are available in the center.
Open a `Terminal` and start checking out the example repos!


# Tree

Classic Notebook view. Use the button on the top right: `Run > Terminal`, but note that multiple terminals (which you may want) will require multiple tabs to view.
